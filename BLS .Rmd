**Objective**:\
To analyze the daily returns of BLS(BLS International) stock from
2018-01-01 to 2023-12-31.\
\
**Analysis**:\
Extracted the adjusted closing prices of BLS stock, calculated daily
returns, and visualized them. Result: The 'Stock_return' plot displays
the daily returns of BLS stock over the specified period.\
\
**Implication**:\
The plot indicates the volatility and direction of daily returns for BLS
stock during the given timeframe. Observations from the plot can help
investors understand the historical performance and risk associated with
AMZN stock.

**Downloading the Stock Data**

```{r}
getSymbols(Symbols = 'BLS.NS', 
           src = 'yahoo', 
           from = as.Date('2018-01-01'), 
           to = as.Date('2023-12-31'),
           periodicity = 'daily')

**Calculating Returns of the stock from Stock Price**

```{r}
Stock_return = na.omit(diff(log(Stock_price)));

```

**Objective:\
**To conduct an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity on
the daily returns of AMZN stock.

**Analysis:\
**Performed the ADF test using the 'adf.test' function and obtained
results.

**Result:\
**The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on BLS daily returns
yields the following results:\
- Dickey-Fuller statistic: -10.733\
- Lag order: 11\
- p-value: 0.01\
- Alternative hypothesis: Stationary\

**Managerial Implication:\
**The ADF test suggests that the daily returns of BLS stock are likely
stationary. The small p-value (0.01) indicates evidence against the null
hypothesis of non-stationarity. Therefore, we have reason to believe
that the BLS stock returns exhibit stationarity, which is important for
certain time series analyses.

```{r}

#ADF test for Stationarity
adf_test_jj = adf.test(Stock_return) ; adf_test_jj
# H0 - Not Stationary (>0.05)
# H1 - Stationary (<0.05) {Favourable}
```

**Objective:\
**To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the daily returns
of AMZN stock.

**Analysis:\
**Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function and
obtained results.

**Result:\
**The Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on BLS daily returns yields the
following results:

\- X-squared statistic: 23.403

\- Degrees of freedom:1

\- p-value: 1.314e-06

**Implication:\
**The Ljung-Box test indicates significant autocorrelation in the AMZN
stock daily returns. The small p-value (1.314e-06) suggests evidence
against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.

**Action:\
**Given the presence of autocorrelation, it may be advisable to consider
an autoARIMA model for time series forecasting. AutoARIMA can help in
automatically selecting an appropriate ARIMA model with differencing to
account for the observed autocorrelation.

```{r}
#Autocorrelation test
# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation
lb_test_ds = Box.test(Stock_return); lb_test_ds # there is no auto-correlation

# H0 - No Auto-correlation (>0.05) { WORST CASE SCENARIO }
# H1 - Auto-correlation exists (<0.05) {Favourable}

#If autocorrelation exists then we can go for autoARIMA

```

```{r}
# Use only if adf fails earlier
diff_Stock <- diff(Stock_return)
diff_Stock <- na.omit(diff_Stock)
adf.test(diff_Stock); adf_test_jj
```

```{r}
# Use only if adf fails earlier and do it on diff
lb_test_ds = Box.test(Stock_return); lb_test_ds
```

**Objective:**\
To perform autoARIMA modeling on the daily returns of BLS Stock
('Stock_Return')\
\
**Analysis:\
** Used the 'auto.arima' function to automatically select the ARIMA
model for both returns and prices.

**Results:\
**For Daily Returns ('Stock_return'): BLS Returns The autoARIMA model
suggests an ARIMA(1,0,0) with zero mean. Coefficients:\
- AR: ar1 to ar5\
- MA: ma1 to ma4\
- sigma\^2 (variance) = 0.0007463\
- Log likelihood = 3288.43\
- AIC=-5174.01 AICc=-5174 BIC=-5163.41\
\
**Implication:**\
The autoARIMA models provide a statistical framework to capture the
underlying patterns in both daily returns and adjusted closing prices of
BLS stock. These models can be used for forecasting future values, and
the AIC, AICc, and BIC values help in model comparison.

#ACF PACF TEST

```{r}
#ACF and PCF
acf(Stock_return) # ACF of JJ Series
pacf(Stock_return) # PACF of JJ Series
# p(ACF) and q(PACF) values for ARIMA
```

```{r}
#AutoArima
arma_pq_ds = auto.arima(Stock_return); arma_pq_ds

# ARIMA ( p value,,,,, if diff then 1 else 0,,,, q value)
```

```{r}
# Manual ARIMA not Reqd ( SKIP )


# ARIMA (1, 0, 1) or AR(1)
ar10 = arima(Stock_return, order = c(1, 0, 0)); ar10

# ARIMA (2, 0, 0) or AR(2)
ar2 = arima(x1, order = c(2, 0, 0)); ar2

# ARIMA (0, 0 , 1) or MA(1)
ma1 = arima(x1, order = c(0, 0, 1)); ma1

# ARIMA (0, 0, 2) or MA(2)
ma2 = arima(x1, order = c(0, 0, 2)); ma2

# ARIMA (0, 0, 3) or MA(3)
ma3 = arima(x1, order = c(0, 0, 3)); ma3

# ARIMA (0, 0, 4) or MA(4)
ma4 = arima(x1, order = c(0, 0, 4)); ma4

# ARIMA (1, 0, 1) or ARMA(1, 1)
arma11 = arima(x1, order = c(1, 0, 1)); arma11

# ARIMA (1, 0, 2) or ARMA(1, 2)
arma12 = arima(x1, order = c(1, 0, 2)); arma12

# ARIMA (1, 0, 3) or ARMA(1, 3)
arma13 = arima(x1, order = c(1, 0, 3)); arma13
```

**Objective**:\
To fit an ARIMA(1, 0, 0) model to the daily returns ('diff_AMZN') of
AMZN stock and generate forecasts.\
\
**Analysis**:\
Used the 'arima' function to fit the ARIMA model and the 'forecast'
function to generate forecasts.\
\
**Results**:\
ARIMA Model (1, 0, 0): Coefficients:\
- AR: ar1 to ar5\
- MA: ma1 to ma4\
- Intercept term\
- sigma\^2 (variance) estimated as 0.001234\
- Log likelihood = 2856.28\
- AIC = -5706.56

**Forecasting:**\
Generated forecasts for the next 500 time points using the fitted ARIMA
model.\
\
**Plot:\
**The plot displays the original time series of daily returns along with
the forecasted values.\
\
**Implication:**\
The ARIMA(1, 0, 0) model is fitted to the historical daily returns of
BLS stock, providing insights into the underlying patterns. The
generated forecast can be used for future predictions, and the plot
visually represents the model's performance.

Note: Interpretation of coefficients and model evaluation details may
require further analysis based on the specific context of the financial
data.

```{r}
#Arima manuplation
arma10 = arima(Stock_return, order = c(1,0,0)); arma10
ds_fpq = forecast(arma10, h = 500)
plot(ds_fpq)
```

**Objective:**\
To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the residuals of the
ARIMA(1, 0, 0) model.\
\
**Analysis:\
**Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function on the
residuals of the ARIMA model and obtained results.\
\
**Results:**\
Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation on Residuals:\
- X-squared statistic: 0.0010178\
- Degrees of freedom: 1\
- p-value: 0.9745\
\
**Implication:**\
The Ljung-Box test indicates significant autocorrelation in the
residuals of the ARIMA(1, 0, 0) model. The low p-value (0.9745) suggests
that there is evidence against the null hypothesis of no
autocorrelation.\
\
**Action:**\
The presence of autocorrelation in residuals shows existence of
volatility

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

```{r}
#Autocorrelation test
# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation
lb_test_ds_A = Box.test(arma10$residuals); lb_test_ds_A
# H0 - No Auto-correlation      >0.05 { Favourable }
# H1 - Auto-correlationn Exists <0.05  

#After this no autocorrelation exists

```

**Objective:**\
To test for volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the residuals
of the ARIMA(5, 0, 4) model.\
\
**Analysis:**\
Conducted Box test and ARCH test on the squared residuals to assess the
presence of volatility clustering.\
\
**Results:**

1.  Box Test for Volatility Clustering:
    -   X-squared statistic: 119.48
    -   Degrees of freedom: 10
    -   p-value: \< 2.2e-16 Inference: The Box test indicates
        significant evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting
        that the return variance series exhibits volatility clustering
        or heteroskedasticity.
2.  ARCH Test for Volatility Clustering:
    -   Chi-squared statistic: 14.025
    -   Degrees of freedom: 10
    -   p-value: 0.719\
        \
        Inference: The ARCH test also provides strong evidence against
        the null hypothesis, supporting the presence of ARCH effects in
        the return series. This implies that the returns have volatility
        clustering.

**Implication:**\
The results from both tests suggest that the residuals of the ARIMA(1,
0, 0) model exhibit volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity.
Understanding and accounting for this pattern in volatility is essential
for risk management and forecasting.

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

```{r}
# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: Box Test 
stk_ret_sq = arma10$residuals^2 # Return Variance (Since Mean Returns is approx. 0)
plot(stk_ret_sq)
stk_ret_sq_box_test = Box.test(stk_ret_sq, lag = 10) 
# H0: Return Variance Series is Not Serially Correlated     >0.05
# H1: Return variance is Serially Correlated                <0.05 { Favourable }
stk_ret_sq_box_test 
# Inference : Return Variance Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)
```

```{r}
# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
stk_ret_arch_test = ArchTest(arma10$residuals^2, lags = 10) 
# H0: No ARCH Effects     >0.05 {Current ARIMA is sufficient}
# H1: ARCH Effects Exists <0.05 {Go for GARCH Modelling}
stk_ret_arch_test

```

**\
Objective:**\
To fit GARCH models to the residuals of the ARIMA(1, 0, 0) model and
test for volatility clustering.\
\
**Analysis:**\
Fitted two GARCH models ('garch_model1' and 'garch_model2') to the
residuals and performed an ARCH test on squared residuals.\
\
**Results:**

1.  GARCH Model 1:
    -   sGARCH(1,1) model with ARIMA(1,0,0) mean.
    -   Optimal Parameters:
        -   mu (Mean): 0.1603
        -   omega: 0.05701
        -   alpha1: 0.27859
        -   beta1: 0.13654
    -   Log likelihood: -2079.392
    -   Weighted Ljung-Box Test on Standardized Residuals and Squared
        Residuals show significant autocorrelation.
    -   Weighted ARCH LM Tests indicate evidence of ARCH effects.

**Implication:** GARCH model suggests that the residuals exhibit
volatility clustering. The ARCH test further supports the presence of
heteroskedasticity in the squared residuals.

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

```{r}
#Garch model
garch_model1 = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(1,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(0,0), include.mean = TRUE))
nse_ret_garch1 = ugarchfit(garch_model1, data = arma10$residuals^2); nse_ret_garch1
```

```{r}
# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
gar_resd = residuals(nse_ret_garch1)
stk_ret_arch_test1 = ArchTest(gar_resd, lags = 1) 
# H0: No ARCH Effects     >0.05
# H1: ARCH Effects Exists <0.05 
stk_ret_arch_test1 
# Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)
```

**Objective:**\
To fit a GARCH model to the daily returns of BLS stock and assess the
goodness-of-fit using the Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test.\
\
**Analysis:\
**Used the 'ugarchspec' and 'ugarchfit' functions to fit a GARCH model
and performed the Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test.\
\
**Results:\
**GARCH Model:\
- sGARCH(1,1) model with ARIMA(1,0,0) mean.\
- Optimal Parameters are not provided in the output.

Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test: - The test was performed for
different group sizes (20, 30, 40, and 50). - For each group size, the
test statistic and p-value were calculated. - All p-values are extremely
low (e.g., 3.193e-60), indicating strong evidence against the null
hypothesis of a good fit.

**Implication:** The Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test suggests that
the fitted GARCH model may not provide a good fit to the observed daily
returns of BLS stock. The low p-values indicate a significant
discrepancy between the model and the observed data.

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

```{r}

garch_modelf = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(1,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1,0), include.mean = FALSE))
stk_ret_garch = ugarchfit(garch_modelf, data = Stock_return); stk_ret_garch

```

**Objective:**\
To forecast volatility using the fitted GARCH model for the next 50 time
points. Analysis: Used the 'ugarchforecast' function to generate
volatility forecasts for the next 50 time points.

**Results:**

**GARCH Model Forecast:** -\
Model: sGARCH\
- Horizon: 50\
- Roll Steps: 0\
- Out of Sample: 0

0-roll forecast [T0=2022-03-02]:\
- Forecasted Series:\
- T+1 to T+50:\
Contains forecasted values of volatility (Sigma) for each time point.

**Implication:**\
The forecasted values represent the predicted volatility for the next 50
time points based on the fitted GARCH model. These forecasts can be
useful for risk management and decision-making, providing insights into
the expected future volatility of the financial time series.

```{r}
# GARCH Forecast
stk_ret_garch_forecast1 = ugarchforecast(stk_ret_garch, n.ahead = 50); stk_ret_garch_forecast1
```

```{r}
plot(stk_ret_garch_forecast1)
```
